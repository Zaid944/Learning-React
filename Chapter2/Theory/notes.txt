code -> code splitting, caching, minifying
npm -> node package manager
standard repository of packages
package.json is a config for dependencies
webpack, vite, parcel
dev and normal dependency
dev -> when development requires
package.json -> version of a package
package.lock.json -> keep a track of exact version
node modules-> all dependencies
each dependency has it's own package.json
put package.json and package.lock.json on github
whatever we can regenerate don't put it on github
npm -> calling package manager, npx -> executing the packages
npx (package name)
cdn not a preferred way 
makes a network call in cdn
auto loading -> is done by parcel
Hot Module Replacement
File Watching Algorithm
Parcel also does image optimization
can host on HTTPS
remove unused code 
dev and prod build
remove main : index.js since in npx 
parcel build we are specifying the entry point index.html
